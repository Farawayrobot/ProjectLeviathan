*working title*

The enlightened masters of the paranaus are the highest caste.

They are breed in specialized breeding mothers that amplify the natural psionic powers and afford the offspring a heightened intelligence which is further amplified if the larva is deemed exceptional enough to deserve exalted ascension. Larva that are deemed unfit for exalted ascension are often given powerful hosts, and serve as generals and other high ranking warriors. examples of these hosts are the sanguine, dire creatures of the sea. Paragon larva that are deemed unfit for any ascension are forced into a metamorphosis that changes them into a jellyfish like existence where they serve as powerful psionic nodes in the greater paranaus network.  

The larve fit for exalted ascension will be given a merfolk to be it's host. Only the fairest and most graceful of the merfolk are selected to be hosts. Because of this need the paranaus have enslaved and oppressed the majority of the merfolk of the oceans.

The highest order of this caste is ruling council of the paranaus. The number of these individuals will vary greatly as they are oft to take matters into their own hands, leading on the front lines as it were. When within the psionic network these members are of one mind, when outside of the network there is no individuality that is gained and acts as a sort of clone of the greater body, memories are reintegrated into the collective upon return to the network.
